# Intrroduction
## The Efficient-Store Dashboard is a high-level analytics tool developed to help retail executives monitor key business metrics through an intuitive and visually engaging interface. Designed and implemented using Tableau Public, this dashboard provides real-time visibility into operational performance by consolidating key indicators, including sales, profit, customer volume, and order flow. 
Project Objectives
• To create a single-view dashboard summarising essential KPIs for executive stakeholders.
• To enable data filtering by region, category, and year for flexible insights.
• To support faster, more informed decision-making across departments.
Design Rationale
Retail operations often generate large amounts of data across sales channels, regions, and product categories. Static reporting methods tend to obscure actionable insights, especially for time-pressed decision-makers. This project addressed the need for dynamic, executive-level reporting, allowing users to explore performance data interactively, identify patterns, and respond to business challenges quickly.
Tools & Techniques Used
• Software: Tableau Public, Excel
• Data Features: Filters, calculated fields, parameters, tooltips, and visual KPIs
• Visual Elements: Horizontal bar charts, pie charts, stacked bars, and time-series line charts
• Layout Features: Executive vs. Table views, icon-based navigation, and a year-selector toggle
• Styling: Custom colour palette and minimalist layout for print clarity
Key Outcomes
The outcome of this project is highlighted in the KPIs within the dashboard.
Recommendations
To improve its functionality and reach, the following future enhancements are suggested:
• Add drill-down capabilities for product-level analysis.
• Incorporate real-time data connections for current reporting.
• Enable predictive analytics using Tableau's built-in forecasting tools.
• Optimise layout for mobile and tablet screens.
• Automate email distribution of dashboard snapshots.
