# Optimising Retail Sales Performance for Business Efficiency

## Background

Efficient-Store operates within a highly competitive retail landscape, offering a wide range of products to both individual and corporate clients across multiple regions. As the company pursues growth and expands its market presence, it has become increasingly important to gain deep insights into sales performance, customer segmentation, and operational efficiency. There is fragmented information on the existing business-critical data that is dispersed across different systems, making it difficult to obtain a unified view of performance. Managers lack real-time visibility into key sales and operational trends, impacting timely decision-making. There is an existing customer insight gap with no clear segmentation or personalised marketing, which makes service efforts less effective. However, inefficient reporting, manual data aggregation, and reporting processes are time-consuming and prone to error, slowing strategic planning and affecting the company’s efficiency, targeted marketing, and sustained competitive advantage as the company struggles to grow.

## Current Challenges

Business Challenges

•	Regional Sales Variability – Significant performance differences across geographic regions.
•	Customer Retention – High churn observed in certain product categories.
•	Profitability Concerns – Some product segments underperform in terms of profit margins.

Data Challenges

•	Time-Series Gaps – Limited understanding of sales trends over time.
•	Data Preparation – Inconsistent preprocessing methods leading to inefficiencies.
•	Data Integration – Fragmented sources requiring cleaning and restructuring.
