# Optimising Retail Sales Performance for Business Efficiency

## Background

Efficient-Store operates within a highly competitive retail landscape, offering a wide range of products to both individual and corporate clients across multiple regions. As the company pursues growth and expands its market presence, it has become increasingly important to gain deep insights into sales performance, customer segmentation, and operational efficiency. There is fragmented information on the existing business-critical data that is dispersed across different systems, making it difficult to obtain a unified view of performance. Managers lack real-time visibility into key sales and operational trends, impacting timely decision-making. There is an existing customer insight gap with no clear segmentation or personalised marketing, which makes service efforts less effective. However, inefficient reporting, manual data aggregation, and reporting processes are time-consuming and prone to error, slowing strategic planning and affecting the company’s efficiency, targeted marketing, and sustained competitive advantage as the company struggles to grow.

## Current Challenges

Business Challenges
•	Regional Sales Variability – Significant performance differences across geographic regions.
•	Customer Retention – High churn observed in certain product categories.
•	Profitability Concerns – Some product segments underperform in terms of profit margins.
Data Challenges
•	Time-Series Gaps – Limited understanding of sales trends over time.
•	Data Preparation – Inconsistent preprocessing methods leading to inefficiencies.
•	Data Integration – Fragmented sources requiring cleaning and restructuring.

## Aim
To design and develop an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides a 360° view of sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making for improved efficiency, customer insights, and profitability optimisation.

## Objectives
•	Explore and analyse Just-store's sales performance across regions, categories, and time.
•	Identify high-performing and underperforming products and segments.
•	Optimize the decision-making process with actionable insights.
•	Develop a Tableau dashboard for efficient data visualization and real-time decision support.

## Integration Strategy 
The project covers the following integration and scope areas:
•	Data Sources: Superstore dataset (Orders, Returns, People).
•	Data Preparation: Cleaning, joining, blending, and pivoting datasets as needed.
•	Metrics & KPIs: Sales, Profit, Quantity, Discount, Customer Segmentation.
•	Visualization Scope:
o	Regional sales performance
o	Profitability by category
o	Time-series sales and forecasting
o	Customer churn analysis
•	Deployment: Portfolio-ready dashboard published via Tableau Public.

## Steps
1.	Data Connection
o	Connect to Superstore dataset and identify data types (dimensions vs. measures).
2.	Data Preparation
o	Apply joins, blending, and unions where required.
o	Use Pivot and Data Interpreter for restructuring.
3.	Exploratory Analysis
o	Build charts (bar, line, pie, packed bubbles, etc.).
o	Apply filters (dimension, measure, date, Top N).
4.	Dashboard Development
o	Combine multiple worksheets into a single interactive dashboard.
o	Add filters, tooltips, KPIs, and reference lines.
5.	Time-Series Analysis
o	Apply forecasting models to predict future sales trends.
6.	Publishing
o	Optimize dashboard layout for clarity and performance.


## Tools & Techniques Used
• Software: Tableau Public, Excel
• Data Features: Filters, calculated fields, parameters, tooltips, and visual KPIs
• Visual Elements: Horizontal bar charts, pie charts, stacked bars, and time-series line charts
• Layout Features: Executive vs. Table views, icon-based navigation, and a year-selector toggle
• Styling: Custom colour palette and minimalist layout for print clarity

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates proficiency in data visualisation, dashboard creation, and business insight By solving real-world challenges such as sales variability, profitability optimisation, and customer retention, the project highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) that empower organisations to make faster, smarter decisions.
